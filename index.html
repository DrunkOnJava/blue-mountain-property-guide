            <h3>A. BMPOA OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>The Blue Mountain Property Owners Association (BMPOA) serves as the governing body for our mountain community. As a homeowner in Blue Mountain, you are automatically a member of this association, which is dedicated to preserving and enhancing our unique mountain lifestyle.</p>
            
            <h4>1. PURPOSE &amp; MISSION</h4>
            <p>As outlined in our bylaws, the purpose of the BMPOA is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of its members</li>
                <li>To preserve the natural beauty of the subdivision and its environment</li>
                <li>To assist members with matters relating to both internal roads and public roads</li>
                <li>To oversee community recreation facilities</li>
                <li>To enforce the Covenants</li>
                <li>To assist members with federal, state, and local matters affecting their property</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. LEGAL STATUS</h4>
            <p>The BMPOA is a legally established non-profit organization incorporated under Virginia law. The Association operates according to its bylaws and the Blue Mountain Subdivision Declaration of Protective Covenants, Conditions &amp; Restrictions, which run with the land and are binding on all property owners.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH BMPOA</h4>
                <p>As a Blue Mountain property owner, you are automatically a member of the Association. There are no additional dues required for membership, as community maintenance and services are funded through the Blue Mountain Sanitary District tax, which is collected with your Warren County property taxes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>3. MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE</h4>
            <p>The BMPOA is managed by an elected Board of Officers and Directors who volunteer their time to serve the community. The Board consists of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Five Officers (President, First Vice President, Second Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer)</li>
                <li>Four Directors-at-Large</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            
            <h4>1. WHAT IS A SANITARY DISTRICT?</h4>
            <p>A Sanitary District is a special taxing district allowed by the Code of Virginia. It provides a mechanism for communities like ours to fund necessary infrastructure and services through a dedicated tax assessment on properties within the district.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Key Benefit</h4>
                <p>Our Sanitary District status ensures that all property owners, including developers, contribute fairly to the maintenance of our roads and community assets.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h4>2. BLUE MOUNTAIN SANITARY DISTRICT</h4>
            <p>The Blue Mountain Subdivision Sanitary District was created by Order of the Circuit Court of Warren County. By agreement with the Warren County Board of Supervisors, the BMPOA Executive Board serves as the managing agent of the Sanitary District.</p>
            
            <h4>3. HOW A SANITARY DISTRICT IS CREATED</h4>
            <p>The Board of Supervisors of any county, upon the petition of 50 qualified voters of a proposed district, or if the proposed district contains less than 100 qualified voters upon petition of 50% of the qualified voters of the proposed district, may adopt an ordinance creating a sanitary district.</p>
            
            <p>To approve, the Board of Supervisors must find that creation of the proposed district or enlargement of the existing district is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Necessary</li>
                <li>Practical</li>
                <li>Fiscally responsible</li>
                <li>Supported by at least 50% of persons who own real property in the district</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>4. KEY BENEFITS OF SANITARY DISTRICT STATUS</h4>
            <p>Our Sanitary District status provides numerous advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Uniform Funding:</strong> Establishes consistent fees throughout the entire subdivision</li>
                <li><strong>Reliable Collection:</strong> Taxes are collected by the Warren County Treasurer's Office, ensuring a high collection rate</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Deductibility:</strong> Sanitary district taxes may be deductible on federal income tax returns (consult your tax advisor)</li>
                <li><strong>Universal Participation:</strong> All lots, including those owned by developers, are subject to the tax</li>
                <li><strong>Property Value Protection:</strong> Unpaid taxes must be satisfied before property sales, protecting community resources</li>
                <li><strong>Disaster Relief Eligibility:</strong> Qualifies the community for various state and federal disaster relief funds</li>
                <li><strong>Private Road Protection:</strong> Sanitary district status does not affect the privacy of our roads or other amenities</li>
                <li><strong>Higher Collection Rate:</strong> County collection fee is 5% plus $350.00, much less than collection firms charge for delinquent accounts</li>
                <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Can increase property values and improve the credit status of the district</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h4>6. POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS</h4>

                <li>If not operated properly, the County has the authority to step in and take over operations.</li>
                <li>Must follow County/State procurement requirements.</li>
                <li>Must have an annual audit performed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A. COMMUNITY ORIGINS</h3>
            <p>Created in the late 1950's as a vacation community for Washington D.C. residents, Blue Mountain has become a mix of summer residents and families establishing year-round homes. The area is known for its scenic overlooks and seasonal wildflowers as well as a peaceful and serene mountain getaway.</p>
            
            <p>The Subdivision is a Sanitary District in Warren County and is managed by an executive board elected by the property owners.</p>
            
            <h4>1. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT</h4>
            <p>Blue Mountain was developed in phases, with the initial roads and infrastructure laid out to maximize the natural beauty of the terrain. The Sanitary District was established to ensure ongoing maintenance of these private roads and community amenities.</p>
            
            <p>Over the decades, the community has grown steadily, with a mix of year-round residents and weekend/vacation homeowners. Many of the original homes have been renovated and expanded, while new construction continues as remaining lots are developed.</p>
            
            <h4>2. COMMUNITY CHARACTER</h4>
            <p>Since its inception, Blue Mountain has maintained a commitment to preserving its natural environment and fostering a strong sense of community. Unlike many modern subdivisions, Blue Mountain has retained much of its original wooded character, with homes nestled among mature trees on spacious lots.</p>
            
            <p>The community's founding principles continue to guide its development, with an emphasis on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respecting the natural landscape</li>
                <li>Maintaining privacy between homes</li>
                <li>Preserving wildlife habitat</li>
                <li>Creating a close-knit community through shared spaces and activities</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A. ANNUAL CHIPPING &amp; FIRE MITIGATION</h3>
            
            <h4>1. FREE ANNUAL WOOD CHIPPING</h4>
            <p>All property owners within the BMPOA Sanitary District are eligible for free wood chipping annually. This valuable service helps reduce fire hazards around homes while providing a convenient way to dispose of woody debris.</p>
            
            <p><strong>FIRE PREVENTION BENEFIT:</strong> Property owners are highly encouraged to participate in the cleanup as it helps reduce the risk and impact of fire events on our mountain. Removing dead branches, brush, and small trees creates defensible space around your home--one of the most effective wildfire protection strategies.</p>
            
            <h4>2. PARTNERSHIP WITH VIRGINIA FORESTRY</h4>
            <p>The wood-chipping program is conducted in partnership with the Virginia Department of Forestry as part of their wildfire prevention efforts. This collaboration reflects the recognition of Blue Mountain as a Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) area where homes are interspersed with natural vegetation that can fuel wildfires.</p>
            
            <p>Benefits of this partnership include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to professional equipment and expertise</li>
                <li>Cost-sharing that makes the program financially sustainable</li>
                <li>Educational resources on creating defensible space</li>
                <li>Follow-up assessments and recommendations</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="paper-page">            
            <h4>3. CHIPPING SCHEDULE</h4>
            <p>Wood chipping typically occurs in early spring to ensure that severe weather known to cause deadfall has passed. The process spans over a week and will be announced several weeks in advance on the website and community communications.</p>
            
            <p>The timing is strategic to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow residents to clean up winter debris</li>
                <li>Prepare properties before spring growth begins</li>
                <li>Create defensible spaces before the spring fire season</li>
                <li>Accommodate both weekend and full-time residents</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A. ROADS &amp; WINTER WEATHER GUIDELINES</h3>
            
            <h4>1. ROAD MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
            <p>Blue Mountain's roads are privately owned and maintained by the BMPOA through Sanitary District funds, with the exception of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fire Trail Road:</strong> This road is NOT owned or maintained by BMPOA. For concerns, contact VDGIF Region 4 Board of Directors.</li>
                <li><strong>State-Maintained Roads:</strong> Certain connecting roads like portions of Blue Mountain Road and Freezeland Road are maintained by VDOT.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The BMPOA Roads Committee oversees maintenance, which includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular grading of gravel roads</li>
                <li>Pothole filling</li>
                <li>Drainage management</li>
                <li>Winter weather response</li>
                <li>Vegetation control along roadways</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. SALT USE PROHIBITED</h4>
            <p>The use of salt on all gravel roads within BMPOA is strictly prohibited as it damages the roadbed and increases maintenance costs for the community. Use approved alternatives for traction instead.</p>
            
            <h4>3. WINTER TRACTION OPTIONS</h4>
            <p><strong>Gravel Chips:</strong> Look for blue poly barrels placed on hills for traction assistance. These barrels contain crushed gravel that can be spread on slippery areas to improve traction. After use, please notify the Roads Committee so barrels can be refilled as needed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Tire Chains:</strong> A great option when road conditions are poor. Ensure they fit your vehicle and practice installation in advance. Modern cable chains are generally easier to install than traditional link chains and usually provide adequate traction for Blue Mountain's roads.</p>
            
            <h4>4. SNOW &amp; ICE REMOVAL</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Plowing begins when snow accumulation reaches 4 inches at a designated location on the mountain.</li>
                <li>Plowing priorities focus on main roads first, then secondary roads as conditions permit.</li>
                <li>Steep sections may require additional attention and are sometimes treated differently than flatter areas.</li>
                <li>During heavy snowfalls, multiple plowing passes may be needed as the storm progresses.</li>
                <li>Please be patient during major storms, as some areas may remain unplowed until conditions improve.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>5. WINTER DRIVING TIPS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintain a greater following distance on slippery roads</li>
                <li>Brake gently to avoid skidding</li>
                <li>Drive slowly and accelerate and decelerate slowly</li>
                <li>Know your brakes - whether you have anti-lock brakes or not</li>
                <li>Don't stop when going up a hill if possible</li>
                <li>Stay home if conditions are dangerous</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>1. AVAILABLE PROVIDERS</h4>
            <p>Several internet service options are available to Blue Mountain residents:</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <p><strong>Xfinity/Comcast:</strong> Cable internet service is available in many parts of Blue Mountain, offering relatively high-speed options. Contact them at 1-855-399-1542 to check availability at your specific address.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>HughesNet:</strong> Satellite internet service is available throughout the entire community, regardless of terrain or tree coverage. While speeds are typically slower than cable options, it may be the only option for certain locations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Viasat:</strong> Another satellite internet provider serving the Blue Mountain area, offering various plans with different speed and data allowances.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <p><strong>CenturyLink:</strong> DSL service may be available in some areas of Blue Mountain, though availability and speeds vary significantly by location.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Mobile Hotspots:</strong> Some residents use cellular hotspots from providers like Verizon, AT&amp;T, or T-Mobile, particularly for weekend or occasional use. Coverage quality varies by location on the mountain.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h4>2. INTERNET AVAILABILITY TIP</h4>
            <p>Before committing to a service provider, ask neighbors near your property about their experiences. Internet quality can vary dramatically even between properties on the same road due to terrain and tree coverage. Consider testing cellular signal strength at your property before choosing a mobile hotspot solution.</p>
            
            <h4>3. REMOTE WORK CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
            <p>If you plan to work remotely from Blue Mountain, consider these factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Request a service test before committing to a long-term contract</li>
                <li>Consider having a backup internet option for critical work (e.g., both cable and mobile hotspot)</li>
                <li>Power outages are more common in mountain areas, so a battery backup or generator may be necessary for consistent connectivity</li>
                <li>Some residents install cell signal boosters to improve mobile hotspot performance</li>
                <li>Check with your employer about minimum bandwidth requirements for remote work tools</li>
