    <h2 class="section-subtitle">A. BMPOA OVERVIEW</h2>
    
    <p class="intro-text">The Blue Mountain Property Owners Association (BMPOA) is a Virginia Sanitary District serving the Blue Mountain community in Warren County. Our organization combines the authority of a special taxing district with the community focus of a property owners association.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>About BMPOA</h3>
        <p>Created in the late 1950's as a vacation community for Washington D.C. residents, Blue Mountain is now a mix of summer residents and year-round families. The subdivision operates as a Sanitary District in Warren County, managed by an elected volunteer executive board.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>All Board members are Blue Mountain property owners elected at the Annual Meeting for two-year terms.</p>
    
    <div class="alert-box special-notice">
        <h3>BOARD ELECTIONS 2025</h3>
        <p>The Board nomination window is currently open and closes at midnight, June 30th.

    <h2 class="section-subtitle">B. SANITARY DISTRICT EXPLAINED</h2>
    
    <h3>1. WHAT IS A SANITARY DISTRICT?</h3>
    
    <p>A Sanitary District is a special taxing district allowed by the Code of Virginia. It provides a mechanism for communities like ours to fund necessary infrastructure and services through a dedicated tax assessment on properties within the district.</p>
    
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Key Benefit</h4>
        <p>Our Sanitary District status ensures that all property owners, including developers, contribute fairly to the maintenance of our roads and community assets.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>2. BLUE MOUNTAIN SANITARY DISTRICT</h3>
    
    <p>The Blue Mountain Subdivision Sanitary District was created by Order of the Circuit Court of Warren County. By agreement with the Warren County Board of Supervisors, the BMPOA Executive Board serves as the managing agent of the Sanitary District.</p>
    
    <h3>3. HOW A SANITARY DISTRICT IS CREATED</h3>
    
    <p>Sanitary Districts are established through a formal legal process involving petition to the Circuit Court, public hearings, and court approval. This ensures proper oversight and community input in the creation process.</p>

    <div class="construction-notice">
        <h3>Preamble (September 2024 Update)</h3>
        <p>Works in conjunction with Blue Mountain Declaration of Protective Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions and BMPOA Bylaws (available on BMPOA.org under "Homeowners")</p>
        <p>All submissions/questions go to ARC Chair via "Contact Us" on BMPOA "Homeowners" page; include Name, Email, Property Address; contractors must include sponsoring owner</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>PRE-CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    
    <div class="requirement-section">
        <h4>Notification Process</h4>
        <p>Before applying for any Warren County building permit or zoning variance, owner must notify ARC Chair (include contractors/agents). Submit in writing via return-receipt mail. ARC Chair (or designee) will respond in writing within 30 days with:</p>
        <ol class="response-options">
            <li><strong>Approval</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Disapproval</strong> (with reasons)</li>
            <li><strong>Request for additional information</strong> (owner then has 30 days to supply; ARC has 30 days to respond). If no response in 30 days, deemed approved.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    
    <div class="requirement-section">
        <h4>Plan Approval</h4>
        <p>Construction may not begin until building site plan and detailed plans (materials list, tree removal plan) are approved in writing by ARC. Any deviation from approved plans risks legal action.</p>
        <p>Construction must be sited unobtrusively—use natural flora to screen from access roads. Only remove trees needed for foundation, septic field, and driveway unless extra clearing is approved. All exterior work (painting, siding) completed within one year of start.</p>
