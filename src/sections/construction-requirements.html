        <ul>
            <li>3″ compacted #3 gravel base + 2″ crusher run surface</li>
            <li>10 ft width between ditches</li>
            <li>Proper grading/crowning</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Once inspected/accepted by BMPOA Road Committee, maintenance assumed by BMPOA.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accessory-buildings">
        <h2>Accessory Building Requirements & Restrictions</h2>
        <p>One accessory building per 1-acre lot (other than a garage) if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complies with Warren County setback/size/height ordinances</li>
            <li>Matches primary structure in style/materials</li>
            <li>Pre-approved in writing by ARC</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Warren County Definitions:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Building:</strong> Any roofed structure supported by walls/columns</li>
            <li><strong>Permit Exception:</strong> Accessory structures < 200 sq ft in side/rear yard do not require County permit but still need ARC approval</li>
            <li><strong>Height Limit:</strong> 12 ft average height (average of eaves to ridge and wall height)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Setback Requirements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannot be placed forward of primary residence's front plane</li>
            <li>≥ 50 ft from front property line or any public/private road</li>
            <li>≥ 10 ft from side lot lines</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Considerations:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nonconforming Structures:</strong> Pre-1992 accessory buildings are grandfathered by County but require ARC pre-approval to avoid covenant violations</li>
            <li><strong>Foundations & Additions:</strong> Accessory buildings (on pilings, skids, slabs) must be in side/rear yard</li>
            <li><strong>Within 4 ft of primary structure:</strong> Considered an addition: requires County permit and must meet primary structure setbacks/height</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> ARC approval required even after County approval; violations subject to legal action.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fence-requirements">
        <h2>Fence Requirements</h2>

            <li>Submit design/materials plan to ARC for written approval</li>
            <li>Exceptions case-by-case based on compatibility</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="compliance">
        <h2>Failure to Comply</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>BMPOA/ARC notifies owner in writing of violation and required corrective action</li>
            <li>Owner has 60 days to correct or 20 days to submit alternative plan/timetable</li>
            <li>ARC has 30 days to approve/disapprove alternative plan; no response = deemed approved</li>
            <li>If alternative denied, owner has 60 days to comply</li>
            <li>Appeals to Arbitration Committee within 30 days; if denied, owner must comply within 30 days or Board may pursue legal action</li>
