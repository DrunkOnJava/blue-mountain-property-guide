        <p class="greeting">Dear Neighbor,</p>

        <p>On behalf of the Blue Mountain Property Owners Association Board of Directors, we warmly welcome you to our mountain community. Whether you are a new resident, a longtime homeowner, or a visitor, we are delighted you are here.</p>

        <p>Blue Mountain has been a special place since the late 1950s, when it was established as a vacation retreat for Washington, D.C. area residents seeking clean mountain air and peaceful surroundings. Today, we are a vibrant mix of seasonal and year-round families who share a commitment to preserving the natural beauty and neighborly spirit that make our community unique.</p>

        <p>This guide provides comprehensive information about living in Blue Mountain, from governance and community services to recreational opportunities and safety guidelines. We encourage you to reference it often and to participate actively in our community life.</p>

        <p>We look forward to seeing you at community events, board meetings, and around the mountain. Together, we continue the tradition of stewardship and fellowship that has defined Blue Mountain for over six decades.</p>

            <strong>The BMPOA Board of Directors</strong></p>
